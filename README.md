# Description
This folder contains my experiments and adventures trying to create Craft eXtensions.
I use the app a lot, so I want to try extending the functionality of the app myself.

## Folders
Each folder is a single extension project. They are either duplicated directly from the [templates provided by the Craft team](https://github.com/craftdocs/craft-extension-project-templates) or created myself (none thus far).

## Projects
1. Import extracted data from the Libby app (csv, json, or html table) into Craft.
